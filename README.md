PeriscopeJS
================
PeriscopeJS is a JavaScript library designed to interact with [Periscope](https://www.periscope.tv/). Periscope just so happens to leave a large amount of information about users and broadcasts public, so PeriscopeJS is designed to access that information.

How to use
----------------
PeriscopeJS is really easy to use. Just link the script in the header of any web page like this:

`<script src="periscope.js"></script>`

It doesn't need any external libraries like JQuery.

PeriscopeJS has two functions available: PerJS.getUserInformation and PerJS.getBroadcastInformation. You can use PerJS.getUserInformation to retrieve information about a user profile, and PerJS.getBroadcastInformation to retrieve information about a broadcast (live or ended).

For example, to retrieve the display name of a user, you do this:

`PerJS.getUserInformation('corbindavenport', 'display_name')`

The first parameter is the username, and the second is the property you are requesting. This is true for both functions.

Here is the available calls for PerJS.getUserInformation:
